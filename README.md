# About

SheTreks is an app for solo female travellers, providing a platform to connect, share experiences, and explore together safely. With this app, you can filter activities based on your interests and join in on adventures with other like-minded travellers.

Travelling alone doesn't have to be lonely anymore.

## Installation

This is the backend server for the application. The Bun server runs on [Hono](https://github.com/honojs/hono) ![logos--hono](https://github.com/jasperteo/SheTreks-backend/assets/12832610/c13f4072-8e2e-4fea-9aca-e68d38d47f77) as the web framework and uses [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun) ![logos--bun](https://github.com/jasperteo/SheTreks-frontend/assets/12832610/f90039c3-38ee-4fb5-8ff0-1edabc38b65e) as the package manager and JavaScript runtime. It interfaces with the [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/postgres/postgres) ![logos--postgresql](https://github.com/jasperteo/SheTreks-backend/assets/12832610/bcee447e-e65f-4a2f-b585-3ca3e628ad61) database via [Sequelize](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize) ![logos--sequelize](https://github.com/jasperteo/SheTreks-backend/assets/12832610/29f395ca-12d0-451b-b6d5-d454fa10582c) as the objectâ€“relational mapping tool.
